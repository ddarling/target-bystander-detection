#target-bystander-detection

This repository hosts the dataset asit was used for our target/bystander detection paper.

In order to adapt the methods presented in the manuscript to alternative datasets, we recommend preprocessing images to size 112x112.
Photos of any size can be utilized, but they first must be downscaled/upscaled to a standard size.

The methods proposed in the paper can be directly utilized as long as the appropriate preprocessing steps are taken.
